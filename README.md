# Summary

UD Welsh-CCG (Corpws Cystrawennol y Gymraeg) is a treebank of Welsh,
annotated according to the Universal Dependencies guidelines.


# Introduction

The main part of the annotated sentences come from the Welsh Wikipedia. 
Some sentences have been taken from the Corpus of the Welsh Assembly, 
from websites of Welsh speaking organisations (Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, University of Wales), 
News (y Golwg, local Welsh language newspapers, BBC Cymru) and Welsh language blogs.
A few example sentences are taken from Welsh Grammars (Gramaded Cymraeg Cyfoes: Gareth King, Modern Welsh).
